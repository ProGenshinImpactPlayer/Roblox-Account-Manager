# Fork
This is a forked version of the original Roblox Account Manager, I think the original maintainer is making the project going to the wrong path, so I have decided to maintain a new version of this account manager myself.

As I am starting out, pull requests are welcomed.

# Roblox Account Manager
Application that allows you to add multiple accounts into one application allowing you to easily play on alt accounts without having to change accounts

Useful for games that require grinding off other players, or storage accounts that hold in game items or currency, or just to have multiple accounts that you can easily find and use.

You are welcome to edit the code and create pull requests if it'll benefit this project.

Multiple Roblox Instances is built into the account manager but [must be manually enabled](https://github.com/ProGenshinImpactPlayer/Roblox-Account-Manager/blob/master/README.md#q-how-do-i-enable-multi-roblox).

# WARNING
If someone asks you to generate an "rbx-player link", **DO NOT** do it, they can use these to join any game using your account, or even launch roblox studio with one of your games. They can do many things in game such as spend your robux or even do things that can get your account terminated. **USE THESE FEATURES AT YOUR OWN RISK**

# Extra Features
Extra features can be enabled by setting DevMode=false to DevMode=true in RAMSettings.ini
Beware of the risks that you are taking if you accidentally send something to someone.

If you ever want a friend to join a game using your account, make sure you have the PlaceId and JobId correctly entered, then right click an account, and click "Copy rbx-player link", DO NOT do this if someone asks you for it.
